I should never have to move something out of an IP ... as long as i have a special
return here op code (like call) ... call can move the next ip position in the current
function to the return address location in the stack frame and for tail optimized stuff
i can just do a jump instead of a call

all functions are statically compiled (and even eval stuff will have a static address
after it's done being compiled).  Which means all of the addresses for places you
would like to set the ip to already exist (you never have to pull something out of IP
... unless you don't have a call op code)

so call is necessary and jump is necessary and then you dont have to worry
about general store/fetch code for ip
